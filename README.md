Identity Bridge makes digital identity and key management simpler and safer. It uses zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) for secure key creation and recovery, removing the need for vulnerable seed phrases. It also introduces Wrapped Identity Tokens (WITs), non-transferable tokens that enable private, seamless identity verification across Web3 and Web2 platforms. Built for privacy and decentralization, Identity Bridge offers a new approach to managing identities securely and efficiently.
